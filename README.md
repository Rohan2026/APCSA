Build-a-World: Simple game of war

Project Description:
The goal is to simulate a game of war between you and an opponent. User can expect to input their name, run a game of war with a bot, and print out the ratio of wins to losses at the end of the session. What makes my world unique is the idea of playing the card game war, which is a concept that is not usually coded online. In addition, printing out the ratio of wins to losses for the player

Key features:
- creating a deck of cards as an array
- Play as yourself against an opponent(a bot)
- the ability to quit the game whenever you want
- User input to give yourself a name and to decide for how long you want to play

How the code works:
There is a main program to run the code. However, the rest of the classes are extended from each other. The Rules class is extended from the class to store cards, because variables like an array for the cards are needed for the rules of the game. In addition, a simulated game is extended from the rules of the game class; which is done so the rules can be implemented to simulate a game of war.
An array is used in the cards class and an array is used in the rules of the game class. It is stored using object creation and methods to modify what is stored in the variables.

How to run the program: 
You just press the run button on code hs or vs code. You will need to input your name and number depending if you want to continue the game or quit

Development Process:
Every sprint goal was made to complete one class. So one sprint would equal the completion of one class, meaning I would have to need 3/4 sprints. What challenges the team had to overcome a lot of errors including shuffling an array of cards, simulating a game of war, and coding all of the cases (win, lost, tie). In addition, finding the motivation to eventually code the project.
What I would improve in the future is to maybe include chips to involve a gambling aspect; and have a shop where you can buy certain abilities and products from the chips that you gamble
